SPI to UART Message Protocol

This project is meant to adapt the PWM3901 SPI sensor to a UART MAVLink message via a lightweight Arduino NANO.
This is useful for flight controllers used on multirotor drones that do not have an SPI bus, but require a PWM3901 (which now seems to be mostly available in SPI)
